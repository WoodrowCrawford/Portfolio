								<p>My name is Woodrow Crawford, and I am an Indie Game Developer. Skilled in Unity and Unreal Engine (and a little bit of Renpy), I acquired my knowledge at Academy of Interactive Entertainment. It was there I proudly walked out with an Advanced Diploma in Professional Video Game Programming And Development.</p>
								<p>Video games have always been my passion while growing up. From old classics like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to the latest games such as Forspoken, watching how games evolved over time fascinated me. My favorite genres were always horror or pixel-like 2D games. While playing, I always asked myself how a particular mechanic worked. "How did the game know to do this?" "Oh, they definitely used a box collider trigger for this mechancic."  Making games is an even more enjoyable experience. Being able to have the ability to create something that players enjoy is such an exhilarating feeling- it makes me feel accomplished. Because I am a person who is knowledge driven, I enjoy teaching myself new things about game development. I do not let failure get to me, as a matter of fact, I embrace it. I believe that the only way to learn and make progress is by failing a few times along the way.</p>
								<p>One of my biggest accomplishments is <a href="https://liquid-moon-productions.itch.io/rogue-star">Rogue Star</a></a>, a stealth like platformer that my team and I developed while in college in Unreal Engine. In it, I contributed to the overall game by creating mechanics such as camera transitions, setting up the animations, and even assisting another teammate with the Ai system.</p>
								<p>My main goal right now is to be able to create a game that players love and enjoy. I am currently in the middle of developing a game called <a href="https://github.com/WoodrowCrawford/Themed-Horror-Game-Jam8-Halloween-Edition" >Insomnia</a>, a horror childlike game made in Unity. Although I am creating something all on my own, I am always open to the options of working at a game studio, big or small.</p>
